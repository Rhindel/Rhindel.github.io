				<p>The islandic artist is famous worlwide for her atypical music and appearance. In 2011, she released the album Biophilia together with an interactive application, an <a target="_blank" href="https://biophiliaeducational.org/">educational project</a> and a	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.biophiliafoundation.org/">biodiversity project</a>.</p>
				<p>I discovered this work when I was randomly picking up CDs at the local media library. We live in a world where you can go to the same restaurant and wear the same clothes almost anywhere in the world. It is the singularity and complexity of the sonorities and atmosphere shaped in Biophilia that caught my attention.</p>

			<h3>Keith Jarrett ~ The Khöln concert</h3>

			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<p>Not only the concert is breathtaking but the story behind it is captivating.</p>
				<p>The staff realized too late that the instrument set-up on stage was in poor condition. At first reluctant to play, Keith Jarrett was convinced by the promotor Vera Brandes as the show was scheduled shortly after. In spite of this tremendous obstacle, the artist managed to perform one of the most famous jazz improvization of history.</p>
				<p>It's a good example that talent and hard work will thrive no matter what.</p>
