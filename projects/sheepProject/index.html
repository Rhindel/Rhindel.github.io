		<p style="text-align: center;">In this game, the key to success is to gather 100 sheep in one barn. Discover how...</p>
		<br/>

		<h4>Move the sheep</h4>
		<p>The herds are just wandering in the pastures, looking for the lushiest grass. To bring them back to your barn, the player can push them in the right direction by touching the table. A counter indicates how many sheep are in the barn.</p>

		<br/>
		<h4>Special actions</h4>
		<p>To access the special action menu, each player can touch the chubby sheep standing in front of their barn. The player can then trigger the action by touching the corresponding icon and choosing the barn to target. Each action will down the score of the player's barn by a few sheep, but it's worth it !</p>

		<p>This game was created for the tactile table of the <a href="http://www.institutimage.fr/" target="_blank" title="Institut Image">Institut Image</a>. Located in the entrance of the building, it's a fun way to welcome visitors and give them a first glimpse of the technology developed onsite.</p>

		<p>The game was developed with Unity in c# and is optimized for a HD 1920*1080 display.</p>
		<p>The project was sequenced in 3 canvas: one for the background and sheep, one for the special actions and one for the menu. One of the objective of the project was to handle multi-touching (it can be up to 40 touches at the same time if the 4 players use all their fingers simultaneously).</p>
		<p>Sheep gameobjects have colliders and rigidbody to detect the interaction with other gameobjects.</p>
		<p>Each touch instantiate a collider and a rigidbody that will act as a shockwave if in contact with a sheep. The icons for the menu and the special actions have Trigger type colliders.</p>
		<p>To each barn, a trigger collider that are only trigger by the sheep when they enter. The score is updated accordingly.</p>
